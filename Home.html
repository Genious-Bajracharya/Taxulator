                    <h1 style="color:aliceblue">Income Tax</h1>
                    <p style="color:aliceblue"> Income tax is a sort of tax imposed by governments on income made by enterprises and persons within 
                        their jurisdiction. Taxpayers are required by law to file an income tax return each year in order to
                        establish their tax obligations.  <br>
                        Governments rely on income taxes to fund their operations. They're used to pay for government obligations, support public services, and give commodities to citizens.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p style="color:aliceblue"><b>Basis of Taxation</b> – Resident individuals are taxed on the income generated, regardless of the source of the income and non-resident individuals are taxed on their Nepalese source income.
                        <br>
                        <b>Filing Status</b>– Each taxpayer shall file a return of income for the tax year within 3 months after the end of such year. An extension of up to 3 months can be given on application.</p>
